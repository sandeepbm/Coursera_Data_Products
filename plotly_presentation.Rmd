## InsectSprays Dataset
The InsectSprays dataset contains the counts of insects in agricultural experimental units treated with different insecticides.  

In the next slide, we construct a boxplot of insect count vs the spray type using **plotly** in order to compare the effectiveness of the different sprays. 

## InsectSprays Plot
```{r warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(plotly)
plot_ly(InsectSprays,y=~count,type="box",color=~spray)
```
